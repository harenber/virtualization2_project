# virtualization2_project
In this repo we'll have the code we develop for the Virtualization2 Project:

Implement webserver to solve the 3-Body problem using a RK method and show the results graphycally in a containerized manner.

The docker compose file is in /compose folder. Simply Run "docker-compose up --build -d" and then visit https://localhost:8123/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To test without docker compose, do:
```bash
sudo docker network create project_network
```
YOu'll need three terminals or run in detatch mode:

Then:
in  virtualization2_project/backend/server
```bash
sudo docker build -t my_server .
sudo docker run --rm  -v "$(pwd)":/server --network=project_network --name project_server my_server
```
Then, do:
in virtualization2_project/build/frontend_container
```bash
sudo docker build -t frontend .
sudo docker run --rm -it --network=project_network -p 8123:8000 frontend
```

then do:
in virtualization2_project/solver_test
```bash
sudo docker build -t solver .
sudo docker run -v ~/Documents/virtualization2_project/backend/server:/solver --rm --network=project_network --name=solver solver
```

side note: 

using -v: Consists of three fields, separated by colon characters (:). The fields must be in the correct order, and the meaning of each field is not immediately obvious.
In the case of named volumes, the first field is the name of the volume, and is unique on a given host machine. For anonymous volumes, the first field is omitted.
The second field is the path where the file or directory are mounted in the container.
